    "## Collaboration\n",
    "At the beginning of this project, we created a what's app group chat as the main communication medium. Sometimes we also held zoom meetings to discuss about the course materials and work together on our group project. Before the submission, the frequency of meetins was high (1-2 times a day). All group members were very engaged without absents. We all function as group leaders and group members. For assignment2, we divide up our tasks:\n",
    "- Create and modify Jupyter notebook template. Enrich contents for each section and write reports. (Tong & Anant)\n",
    "- Data searching, filtering and cleaning. (Thomas)\n",
    "- Create data dictionary. (Jingwen)\n",
    "- Create normalized tables. (Mataikya)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "Housing affordability and costs have been a major trend in Canada over the past several years.\n",
    "We want to examine house prices in Canada and explore household incomes on housing investment.\n",
    "By analyzing those datasets we want to furture explore housing affordability in Canada.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "To do this work we obtained two datasets, one, Housing Prices dataset(New housing price index, monthly), is from Statistics Canada (WAN dataset: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810020501#tables). \n",
    "It contains price index across Canada by province. The second dataset is Income Statistics(Income statistics by economic family type and income source), also from Statistics Canada (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110019101#tables). \n",
    "These datasets both share an attribute, REF_DATE, that can be aggregated by year from Housing Prices dataset, and can be obtained from the first column of Income statistics dataset. Both datasets can be combined to evaluation how people's income affects the housing prices across Canada, and further analyze housing affordability in Canada.\n",

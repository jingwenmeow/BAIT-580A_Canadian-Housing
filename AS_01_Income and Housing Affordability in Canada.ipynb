    "## Collaboration\n",
    "At the beginning of this project, we created a what's app group chat as the main communication medium. Sometimes we also held zoom meetings to discuss about the course materials and work together on our group project. Before the submission, the frequency of meetings was high (1-2 times a day). All group members were very engaged without absents. We all function as group leaders and group members. For the second deliverable of our assignment, we've divided up our tasks in the following manner:\n",
    "- Create and modify Jupyter notebook template. Enrich contents for each section and write reports. (Tong & Anant)\n",
    "- Data searching, filtering and cleaning. (Thomas)\n",
    "- Create data dictionary. (Jingwen)\n",
    "- Create normalized tables. (Mataikya)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "Housing affordability and costs have been a major concern in Canada over the past several years.\n",
    "We want to understand how demographic factors of the homeowners affect affordability of their homes.\n",
    "By analyzing those datasets we want to further explore housing affordability in Canada and how it varies for different individuals.\n",
    "Specifically we want to understand which kind of homeowners usually own higher/lower property prices and find out any identifying factors (such as primary home owner type, couple type) that usually ends up paying more than the average home ownership cost in their location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "To do this work we obtained the following datasets: \n",
    "1. Housing Prices dataset, is from Statistics Canada \n",
    "(WAN dataset: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810020501#tables). \n",
    "It contains price index across Canada by province. \n",
    "2. Income Statistics, \n",
    "This provides aggregate income information metrics for all of Canada as a country and is also sourced from Statistics Canada (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110019101#tables).\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets both share an attribute, REF_DATE, that can be aggregated by year from Housing Prices dataset, and can be obtained from the first column of Income statistics dataset. Both datasets can be combined to evaluation how people's income affects the housing prices across Canada, and further analyze housing affordability in Canada.\n",

Residential homes include single-homes, semi-detached homes and townhomes, and so this dataset does not capture all types of housing available to Canadians. This data has been collected since 1981 for most regions, but there are some missing values depending on the location. This dataset will provide objective measure to see how the cost of single family homes has been changing over time in different areas of Canada.\n",

The “Income statistics by economic family type and income source” dataset will provide granular data on earnings by different family groups and income types. One of the limitations of this dataset is that the data was only collected on a yearly basis which is a longer time interval compared to the housing data which is on a monthly basis. The data in the housing data set could be aggregated in order to relate the two datasets. When relating this dataset to the cost of new housing we will be able to show the changes in income relative to the costs of housing for different family groups.\n"

    "## Collaboration\n",
    "At the beginning of this project, we created a what's app group chat as the main communication medium. Sometimes we also held zoom meetings to discuss about the course materials and work together on our group project. Before the submission, the frequency of meetins was high (1-2 times a day). All group members were very engaged without absents. We all function as group leaders and group members. For assignment2, we divide up our tasks:\n",

    "also from Statistics Canada (https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110019101#tables). \n",
    "These datasets both share an attribute, (time), that can be aggregated by year from Housing Prices dataset, and that is included in the Ref_Data column. In the Income statistics dataset, (time) is included in the () column. Both datasets are coded by date, so we can use these datasets together to evaluation how people's income affects the housing prices across Canada, and further analyze housing affordability in Canada.\n",

    "1. Tell a story for an audience: interleave explanatory text with code and results to create a computational narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Document the process, not just the results: so that others, and yourself later, will understand your reasoning and choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use cell divisions to make steps clear: have eaach cell perform one meaningful and documented step, avoid long cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modularize code: use and document functions for repeated operations to make the code more readable and save space.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Record dependencies: use pip or Conda package manager, with environment.yml (Conda) or requirements.txt (pip). Please indicate package versions explicitly. Ideally, include a listing of dependencies at the bottom of the notebook. Make sure you test your notebook in an environment created from these dependencies, so that you don't add undocumened dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use version control: https://github.com/jupyter/nbdime is a diffing tool specifically designed for notebooks; you may find it useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Build a pipeline: place key variable declarations at the top. Test with different parameters, clean up, and run all cells to prepare for potential non-interactive execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Share and explain your data: if the original data are too big, inlude a sample. Make sure that the data is accessible. Include data description, and any processing done beforehand. Ideally, point to datasets that have been permanently managed and identified by DOIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Design your notebooks to be read, run, and explored:  \n",
    "    9.1. Read: store it in a public code repository with a clear README file and a liberal open source license. Generate HTML/PDF versions of the final notebook.  \n",
    "    9.2. Run: use Binder to run it in the cloud, and/or create a Docker image.  \n",
    "    9.3. Explore: use interactive widgets (e.g., ipywidgets, or panel) \n",
    "    \n",
    "10. Advocate for open research: ask your colleagues or friends to try to run your notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Additional recommendations, beyond the 10 rules:__\n",
    "1. Do not include shell commands in cells (unless the notebook will be distributed in Docker container.)\n",
    "2. Keep cell output if other researchers will use the included data, or clear cell output if they will use their own data.\n",
    "3. Develop your code in a clean virtual environment, to avoid dependency conflicts and streamline packaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a virtual environment, use\n",
